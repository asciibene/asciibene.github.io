<p>I'm not really into the evolution of technology, and have little interest
in getting an actual 'job' in the domain (or any domain for that matter); It seems I just understand computers 
so well... I can easily wrap my head around the abstractions
of this <u>rapidly evolving</u> world...And I dont even need an alma matter or certificate to do so.<br>
I do like playing Nethack though.</p>
<p>I code in various <u>BASIC</u> dialects, such as X11-Basic and smallBasic.<cr>
I also make my own bash scripts when I need them. </p>
<p>Although I can script or program in many languages, I wouldnt call myself a <em>software engineer</em>. But I am however a scripter, I write scripts (rather than progs) that allows me, with some effort, to automate any computing task you could think of.
<p>I believe in <u>chaos</u> and liberty 
this is why I decided to <u>live fully free
</u>.</p>
